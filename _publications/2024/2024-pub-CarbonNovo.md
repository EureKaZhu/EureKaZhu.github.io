  We propose CarbonNovo, a unified energy-based model for jointly generating protein structure and sequence. Specifically, we leverage a score-based generative model and Markov Random Fields for describing the energy landscape of protein structure and sequence. In CarbonNovo, the structure and sequence design module communicates at each diffusion step, encouraging the generation of more coherent structure-sequence pairs. Moreover, the unified framework allows for incorporating the protein language models as evolutionary constraints for generated proteins.
